'Out of the Woods': `Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered

Last December
(Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together
(Back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said "I'm setting you free"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up you were looking at me

You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet?)
